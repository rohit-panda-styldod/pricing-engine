            Review this PR thoroughly. Examine ALL code in the repository, not just the diff. Focus on:

            1. Bugs and logic errors, especially missing input validation
            2. Edge cases that aren't handled (e.g., what happens with extreme or invalid inputs?)
            3. Test coverage gaps -- are there scenarios that should be tested but aren't?
            4. Security vulnerabilities

            Be specific: mention file paths, line numbers, and show example inputs that would trigger issues.
            If you find bugs in EXISTING code (not just the new changes), flag those too.
